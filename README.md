### Offline instructions
Coursera Jupyter Environment can be slow if many learners use it heavily. Our tasks are compute-heavy and we recommend to run them on your hardware for optimal performance.

Follow the instructions on https://hub.docker.com/r/zimovnov/coursera-aml-docker/ to install Docker container with all necessary software installed.

After that you should see a Jupyter page in your browser.

Click New -> Terminal and execute: `git clone https://github.com/hse-aml/intro-to-dl.git`

Close the terminal and refresh Jupyter page, you will see intro-to-dl folder, go there, all the necessary notebooks are waiting for you.

First you need to download necessary resources, to do that open `download_resources.ipynb` and run cells for your week.

Now you can open a notebook for the corresponding week and work there just like in Coursera Jupyter Environment.
